# Keyboard navigation
- modal can be closed easily with close button
- All interactive components are accessible via keyboard

# Well-used HTML
- Buttons use semantic `<button>` tags instead of `<div>` or `<span>`
- `aria-hidden` is used for background elements when modals are open to make the form looks better

# Pictures
- All uploaded images and thumbnails have clear alt texts

# Readability
- High contrast colors are used for text
- Disabled or locked states use seperate colors to avoid confusion
- Font sizes and spacing follow a consistent format
